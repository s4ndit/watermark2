# Bug Fix Summary: getCurrentJobStatus Function

## Issue Description
The `getCurrentJobStatus` function had several critical issues:

1. **Job Status Retrieval Bug**: The function incorrectly handled job status retrieval by treating `getImageJobStatus` and `getVideoJobStatus` as synchronous functions, though they actually are synchronous, but the prioritization logic was flawed.

2. **Job ID Collision**: The function prioritized the image processor, leading to job ID collisions where clients subscribing to video jobs could receive status updates for image jobs with the same ID.

3. **Non-functional Job Status Feature**: Due to the poor logic, the job status feature was not working reliably.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced `getCurrentJobStatus` Function
- **Location**: `server/socket/handlers.js:90-105`
- **Changes**:
  - Added optional `jobType` parameter to specify which processor to check
  - Implemented proper collision detection when both processors have the same job ID
  - Added processor type information to returned status objects
  - Enhanced error handling and logging

### 2. Improved Job Subscription Handler
- **Location**: `server/socket/handlers.js:12-53`
- **Changes**:
  - Updated to accept both string (legacy) and object (new) subscription formats
  - Added support for job type specification in subscriptions
  - Enhanced status emission with processor type information
  - Better collision handling and warnings

### 3. Enhanced Broadcast Functions
- **Location**: `server/socket/handlers.js:160-185`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `processorType` parameter to all broadcast functions
  - Included processor type in all emitted events for better tracking
  - Enhanced debugging capabilities

### 4. Updated Processor Services
- **Files**: `server/services/imageProcessor.js`, `server/services/videoProcessor.js`
- **Changes**:
  - Replaced direct socket emissions with centralized broadcast functions
  - Added processor type identification to all broadcasts
  - Improved error handling and status reporting

### 5. Enhanced API Endpoints
- **Location**: `server/routes/watermark.js`
- **Changes**:
  - Added job type information to job creation responses
  - Updated status endpoint to use enhanced getCurrentJobStatus function
  - Added optional job type parameter to status queries
  - Improved error handling

## Key Improvements

1. **Job ID Collision Prevention**: The system now properly handles cases where multiple processors might have the same job ID
2. **Processor Type Tracking**: All job events now include processor type information for better debugging
3. **Backward Compatibility**: The system supports both legacy and new subscription formats
4. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Better error reporting and collision detection
5. **Improved Debugging**: Added logging and warnings for job ID collisions

## Usage

### Legacy Format (still supported)
```javascript
socket.emit('subscribe-job', jobId);
```

### New Format (recommended)
```javascript
socket.emit('subscribe-job', {
    jobId: jobId,
    jobType: 'image' // or 'video'
});
```

### Status Query with Type
```javascript
GET /api/watermark/status/jobId?type=image
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test job subscription with both legacy and new formats
2. Verify processor type information in job events
3. Test job ID collision scenarios (edge case)
4. Confirm that video jobs don't receive image job updates
5. Validate error handling for invalid job IDs
